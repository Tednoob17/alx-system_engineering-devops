# HTTPS SSL

![](https://www.x-cart.com/img/8527/http_to_https-1.webp)

> SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer and, in short, it's the standard technology for keeping an internet connection secure and safeguarding any sensitive data that is being sent between two systems, preventing criminals from reading and modifying any information transferred, including potential personal details. The two systems can be a server and a client (for example, a shopping website and browser) or server to server (for example, an application with personal identifiable information or with payroll information).

> HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) appears in the URL when a website is secured by an SSL certificate. The details of the certificate, including the issuing authority and the corporate name of the website owner, can be viewed by clicking on the lock symbol on the browser bar.

__What happens when you donâ€™t secure your website traffic?__

## Installing SSL Termination on Haproxy
- Linux Distro: __Ubuntu 20.04 LTS__
- HAProxy Version: __v2.4.3__

```bash

#if you already have haproxy installed do this
$ sudo snap install --classic certbot

# check if haproxy is installed, if yes stop haproxy
$ sudo service haproxy stop

# Install ssl using certbot
$ sudo certbot certonly --standalone

# Follow the instrustions accurately, at the end please take note of the
# Location of your SSL Keys. Usually going to default to the /etc/letsencrypt
# directory. To view them do the below
$ ls /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain_name/

# Now concat your certificate .pem files to a single pem file and save them to
# /etc/ssl/private
$ cat cert_key_1 cert_key_2 > /etc/ssl/private/any_desired_name.pem

# Now go to your haproxy config file to add a the path to your certificate
# Then reload haproxy
$ sudo service haproxy reload
```
_If you don't have HAProxy installed just copy and run this on your terminal and save yourself the hassle_

```
$ wget -O haproxy https://github.com/sammykingx/alx-system_engineering-devops/raw/master/0x0F-load_balancer/install_haproxy_safely && bash haproxy

```
